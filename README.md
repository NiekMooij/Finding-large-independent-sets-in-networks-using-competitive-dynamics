## Overview

This Python package provides efficient algorithms for calculating maximal independent sets in graphs. The project includes various scripts in the `MIS-algorithms` folder, each implementing a different algorithm for computing these sets. The Lotka-Volterra Algorithm and the Continuation Lotka-Volterra Algorithm are both described in the paper "Finding Large Independent Sets in Networks Using Competitive Dynamics".

This directory contains all the code used for the paper "Finding Large Independent Sets in Networks Using Competitive Dynamics".
